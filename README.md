## Roadmap
- Create a new project in PyCharm and create the main.py file.

- In order to create a playlist in Spotify you must have an account with Spotify. If you don't already have an account, you can sign up for a free one here: http://spotify.com/signup/

- here are the steps to create a Spotify app using Spotify API:

- Once you'v signed up Go to the Spotify Developer Dashboard.[  (Click Here)](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)

- Click on Create app
- Add App name (of your choice), App description (of your choice), Redirect URI (hhhh)





- Log in to your Spotify account, or create a new one if you don't have one already.

Click on the "Create an App" button.

Fill in the required information for your app, such as the name and description. You'll also need to agree to the terms of service and privacy policy.

Click on the "Create" button to create your app.

Once your app is created, you'll be taken to the app dashboard. Here, you can find your client ID and client secret. You'll need these to authenticate your app with the Spotify API.

Click on the "Edit Settings" button to configure your app settings. Here, you can add redirect URIs, set permissions, and configure other settings for your app.

Once you've configured your app settings, you're ready to start using the Spotify API! You'll need to authenticate your app using the client ID and client secret, and then you can start making API requests.
